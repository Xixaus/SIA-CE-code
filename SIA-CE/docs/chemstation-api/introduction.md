# ChemStation API Introduction

## What is the ChemStation API?

The ChemStation API provides a comprehensive Python interface for controlling Agilent ChemStation software and CE instruments. It enables complete automation of capillary electrophoresis systems, eliminating the need for manual intervention in routine analytical workflows.

### Communication Architecture

The API operates by sending commands directly to ChemStation's Command Processor (CP). This approach provides:

- **Direct instrument control** through ChemStation's native command structure
- **Simplified operation** with pre-built command functions for common tasks
- **Reliable communication** via file-based protocol between Python and ChemStation

### Development Focus and Compatibility

While the API is designed as a general ChemStation interface, it has been specifically developed and optimized for **Capillary Electrophoresis applications**. Many commands and workflows are tailored for CE operations, though the underlying architecture supports broader ChemStation functionality.

**Testing and Compatibility:**
- **Tested on:** ChemStation version B.04.03-SP2 and B.04.03-SP3
- **Expected compatibility:** Other ChemStation versions should work but have not been extensively tested
- **Requirements:** ChemStation must be running with the specialized communication macro loaded

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
    The API requires ChemStation to be running with a special communication macro. See the [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) guide for setup instructions.

## Key Capabilities

### CE Instrument Control

**Vial and Sample Management:**
- Load and unload vials from carousel to analysis positions (inlet/outlet)
- Control vial positioning with precision and error checking
- Monitor vial presence and validate positions before operations

**Capillary Operations:**
- Automated capillary conditioning and flushing protocols
- Pressure-based sample injection with customizable parameters
- Rinse cycles and maintenance procedures

**System Monitoring:**
- Real-time instrument status monitoring
- Position tracking for all moveable components
- System readiness validation before operations

### Method Management

**Method Operations:**
- Load existing methods from ChemStation method database
- Execute methods with sample-specific information and parameters
- Save modified methods with custom settings
- Validate method existence before execution

**Parameter Control:**
- Modify injection parameters (time, pressure, volume)
- Adjust separation conditions (voltage, temperature)
- Configure detection settings and data acquisition parameters

### Sequence Operations

**Sequence Management:**
- Load and save sequence files from ChemStation database
- Modify sequence tables programmatically
- Import sequence tables from Excel spreadsheets with validation
- Export results and sequence data for external processing

**Execution Control:**
- Start, pause, and resume sequence execution
- Monitor sequence progress with real-time updates
- Handle sequence interruptions and error recovery
- Generate execution reports and logs

### System Monitoring and Control

**Real-Time Status:**
- Continuous monitoring of instrument status and health
- Analysis progress tracking with time estimates
- Temperature, pressure, and voltage monitoring
- Error detection with detailed diagnostic information

**State Management:**
- System readiness validation before starting operations
- Automatic state recovery after interruptions
- Preventive checks to avoid operational conflicts

## How It Works

The ChemStation API uses a sophisticated communication protocol to bridge Python and ChemStation:

### Communication Flow

1. **Command Initiation:** Python sends a command through the API
2. **Protocol Translation:** The command is formatted for ChemStation's Command Processor
3. **File-Based Transfer:** Commands are written to communication files monitored by ChemStation
4. **Macro Processing:** A specialized macro in ChemStation reads commands and executes them
5. **Response Generation:** ChemStation writes responses back to communication files
6. **Python Integration:** The API reads responses and returns results to Python

### Architecture Benefits

- **Reliability:** File-based communication eliminates connection timeouts
- **Bidirectional:** Full command and response capabilities
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error detection and reporting
- **State Synchronization:** Maintains consistent state between Python and ChemStation

# Initialize ChemStation connection
api = ChemstationAPI()

# Pre-operation validation
print("Validating prerequisites...")
api.validation.validate_vial_in_system(15)         # Check sample vial
api.validation.validate_vial_in_system(48)         # Check buffer vial  
api.validation.validate_method_name("CE_Analysis") # Verify method exists

# Prepare instrument for analysis
print("Preparing instrument...")
api.ce.load_vial_to_position(15, "inlet")   # Load sample to inlet
api.ce.load_vial_to_position(48, "outlet")  # Load buffer to outlet

# Condition capillary
print("Conditioning capillary...")
api.ce.flush_capillary(duration=60.0, pressure=950)  # 60-second flush

# Execute analysis
print("Starting analysis...")
api.method.execute_method_with_parameters(
    vial=15,
    method_name="CE_Analysis", 
    sample_name="Sample_001",
    injection_time=5.0
)

# Monitor progress
print("Monitoring analysis progress...")
while api.system.method_on():
    remaining = api.system.get_remaining_analysis_time()
    current_step = api.system.get_current_method_step()
    print(f"Step: {current_step}, Time remaining: {remaining:.1f} minutes")
    time.sleep(30)  # Update every 30 seconds

print("Analysis complete!")

# Optional: Retrieve results
results = api.system.get_analysis_results()
print(f"Analysis completed successfully. Peak count: {results.peak_count}")
