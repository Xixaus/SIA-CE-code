"""
Validation Module - Input validation and system state checking for ChemStation API.

This module provides comprehensive validation capabilities for ChemStation operations
including file existence checking, system state validation, vial presence verification,
and operational readiness assessment. All validation methods raise specific exceptions
when validation fails, enabling robust error handling in automated workflows.

Validation Categories:
- File System: Method and sequence file existence validation
- Vial Management: Carousel vial presence and position validation
- System State: Instrument readiness and operational state checking
- Method Execution: Analysis startup and execution validation
- Batch Operations: Multi-vial validation for sequence operations

    """Comprehensive validation and system state checking for ChemStation operations.
    
    Provides validation methods for all aspects of ChemStation operation including
    file system validation, instrument state checking, vial management validation,
    and method execution verification. All validation methods follow consistent
    patterns and raise specific exceptions for different failure modes.
    
    Validation Philosophy:
        - Fail fast: Detect problems before they cause system errors
        - Specific exceptions: Different failure modes have different exception types
        - Case-insensitive: File and method name checking handles case variations
        - Comprehensive checking: Validate all prerequisites before operations
    
    File System Validation:
        - Method file existence in ChemStation directories
        - Sequence file existence and accessibility
        - Case-insensitive filename matching
        - Path validation and accessibility checking
    
    Instrument State Validation:
        - System readiness for operations
        - Carousel availability and operational state
        - Method execution state verification
        - Error condition detection and reporting
    
    Vial Management Validation:
        - Individual vial presence checking
        - Batch vial validation for sequences
        - Position occupancy verification
        - Carousel state comprehensive monitoring
