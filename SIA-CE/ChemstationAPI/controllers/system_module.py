"""
System Module - ChemStation system monitoring and status management.

Comprehensive monitoring and control of ChemStation system status, method execution
tracking, and diagnostic capabilities for CE instrument operations.

System States Monitored:
- Acquisition Status: STANDBY, PRERUN, RUN, POSTRUN states
- Method Execution: Active/inactive method monitoring  
- Runtime Tracking: Elapsed and remaining analysis time
- Instrument Readiness: Ready state validation for new analyses
- RC Status: Real-time CE module status information

    instrument readiness validation.
    
    Diagnostic Tools:
        - Register browser for system debugging and parameter inspection
