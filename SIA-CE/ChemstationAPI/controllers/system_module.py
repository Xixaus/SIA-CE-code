status, method execution tracking, and diagnostic capabilities. It enables monitoring
of CE instrument states, analysis progress, and system readiness.

System States Monitored:
- Acquisition Status: STANDBY, PRERUN, RUN, POSTRUN states
- Method Execution: Active/inactive method monitoring
- Runtime Tracking: Elapsed and remaining analysis time
- Instrument Readiness: Ready state validation for new analyses
- RC Status: Real-time CE module status information

Diagnostic Features:
- Register inspection tools for debugging
- Error monitoring and system abort capabilities  
- Connection testing and validation
- Performance monitoring and timing analysis
