    """CE method management for analytical method control and execution.
    
    Provides comprehensive method management for ChemStation CE methods including
    file operations, parameter editing, and execution with custom parameters.
    Methods are stored as .M files containing instrument parameters, acquisition 
    settings, and data analysis rules.
    
    Method Execution Modes:
        1. Direct execution: Run current method with existing parameters
        2. Custom execution: Run method with specified data filename  
        3. Parameterized execution: Run method with custom vial/sample information
    
    File Management:
        - Methods stored as .M files in ChemStation method directory
        - Runtime parameter access through RC.NET registers
        - Template execution with parameter modification
    
    Attributes:
        comm: ChemStation communicator for command execution
        validation: Method existence and parameter validation
        system: System state monitoring and control
