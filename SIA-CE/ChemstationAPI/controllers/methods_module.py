    """CE method management for analytical method control and execution.
    
    Provides comprehensive method management capabilities for ChemStation CE methods,
    including file operations, parameter editing through RC.NET registers, method
    execution with custom parameters, and validation of method existence and integrity.
    
    Method File Structure:
        - Methods stored as .M files in ChemStation method directory
        - Contains instrument parameters, acquisition settings, data analysis rules
        - Methods can be loaded, modified, saved with new names
        - RC.NET registers provide runtime parameter access
    
    Method Execution Modes:
        1. Direct execution: Run current method with system defaults
        2. Parameterized execution: Run method with custom vial/sample info
        3. Template execution: Modify register and execute custom analysis
    
    Attributes:
        comm: ChemStation communicator for command execution.
        validation: Validation module for method existence and parameter checking.
